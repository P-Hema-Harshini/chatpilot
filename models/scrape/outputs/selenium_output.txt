The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.[Written by MAL Rewrite]                                Watch NowDetail#2 SpotlightThe Elusive SamuraiTV                                    23m                                    Jul 6, 2024                                    HD11812                                    Eight-year-old Tokiyuki Houjou, the next successor of the Kamakura shogunate, is a young boy lacking talent in everything besides hide-and-seek.

Even if they aren't tagged with PG-18, I ask my cousin, that if I should watch this anime or not. I am well educated and guided and I am very well aware of what type of people thrive on site like this. The reason for me to come here is that I have no money, once i am 13, my parent will start giving me my monthly allowance, then I will switch to the legal platforms.Itadori Yuji#General9 hours ago129Hello there I am new hereHello everyone, I am new here, basically I am new to the anime in general, I am 9 years old, I want to be friends with all of you, but first, suggest me some animes, only anime I have watched is Naruto and JJKItadori Yuji#Question2 hours ago48What would you generally prefer?While watching anime every person have their own opinion.
