Faces are saved as separate images and their embeddings are stored in a SQLite database to manage duplicates and ensure uniqueness.TroubleshootingDuplicate Faces: Ensure that the threshold in the embedding_exists function is properly set to avoid duplicates.Missing Files: Check file paths and ensure that the server has proper access permissions to read/write files.ContributingFeel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
